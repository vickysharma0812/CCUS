# Introduction to CCS/CCUS

The adverse effects of climate change on the environment drive the implementation of technologies to reduce CO2 emissions. In 2015, most nations confirmed their commitment to the [[Paris-Agreement]], where they agreed to fight global warming by limiting the temperature increase to $1.5 {}^{\circ}C$ above pre-industrial levels. These countries started making technological efforts in developing strategies to curtail their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

In 2015 and 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [[IPCC-2018]] and [[IPCC-2015]]  recognized the decisive role of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) to reduce carbon dioxide emissions during this century, which could limit the temperature increase to the desired target of $1.5 {}^{\circ}$.
 
In most of the large-scale CCS facilities, the storage of CO2 is combined with enhanced oil recovery (EOR) ([Global CCS Institute, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221003275#bb0690)). However, such facilities exist only in few countries (e.g., US, Norway, UK, Australia, Canada). Besides, the fraction of CO2 captured and stored is still insignificant compared to the emissions overall. The most challenging part of the widespread implementation of CCS is identifying suitable geological sites for CO2 storage. 

At present, the CO2 can be trapped/contained inside a geological media by the following means

- structurally due to the presence of a sealing unit/caprock (structural trapping)
- through the dissolution of the CO2 in the formation water (solution trapping)
- as immobile disconnected blobs formed when water re-imbibes the pore space (occupied by CO2) by the action of capillary forces (capillary trapping)
- through mineralization reactions leading to the formation of carbonate-rich minerals (mineral trapping)

## Storage sites

## Chalks [1](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Assessing%20the%20European%20potential%20for%20geological%20storage&publication_year=2004&author=N.P.%20Christensen&author=M.%20Larsen) [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610209006778)[3](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01163065)

> Recently, the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) has awarded nearly DKK 10 million to the Greensand project, which is a feasibility study of the storage of CO2 captured at onshore industrial facilities into offshore depleted Danish oil fields.

> Although most hydrocarbon reservoirs in Denmark are chalk fields ([Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221003275#f0010)), CO2 is planned to be stored (0.5–1 Mt/year) in a sandstone formation, the Nini field, and later expanded to the Nini East, Cecilie, and Siri fields (sandstone reservoirs) and store up to 4 Mt CO2/year for the next 20 years ([Nielsen, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221003275#bb1330))

Upper Cretaceous to Palaeocene age chalk deposits are yet widely spread around the world representing economically important aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs in many places ([Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221003275#f0015)). In addition to the Tor and Ekofisk hydrocarbon-bearing formations, actively producing in the Dutch, UK, Norwegian,0 and Danish sectors of the North Sea, examples include the onshore chalk aquifers of southern and eastern England, northern France, northern Germany, Denmark, as well as hydrocarbon reservoirs located in the Austin and Niobrara chalk in the US.

## Sandstone

Sandstones also represent the predominant lithology for CO2 storage projects worldwide.
