# The Synergetic Utilisation Of CO2 Storage Coupled With Geothermal Energy Deployment

Website: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/about/

## About

The Synergetic Utilisation Of CO2 Storage Coupled With Geothermal Energy Deployment (SUCCEED) project brings together [eight partners](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/partners/) from across academia and industry interested in CO2 capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).

The project aims at accelerating and maturing the use of CCUS by developing, testing and demonstrating measurement, monitoring and verification technologies that can be used in most CO2 geological storage projects.

The team will be working with two existing facilities at [Kizildere in Turkey](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/pilot-sites/kizildere/) and [Hellisheidi in Iceland](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/pilot-sites/hellisheidi/).

Led by [Professor Sevket Durucan](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.durucan "Professor Sevket Durucan link opens in a new window") at Imperial College London, SUCCEED will run for three years and is funded by [ACT](http://www.act-ccs.eu/ "ACT link opens in a new window"),  an international initiative to establish CCUS as a tool to combat global warming.

## Objectives

The objectives of the project are to:

1.  Research and demonstrate the feasibility of utilising produced CO2 for re-injection to improve geothermal performance, while also storing the CO2
2.  Develop further, test and demonstrate innovative monitoring technologies:
    -   New higher signal-to-noise ratio distributed fibre-optic acoustic sensing system (iDAS)
    -   New permanent and highly repeatable vibratory-type (environmentally friendly) seismic monitoring electric seismic-vibrators
3.  Test and demonstrate the industrial CCUS opportunity for geothermal field operators to:
    -   Maintain and enhance reservoir pressure as the driving mechanism for the geothermal fluid and improve geothermal performance,
    -   Increase reservoir permeability and productivity while suppressing scaling by artificial acidification
4.  Utilise advantageous operational field environments, facilitated by thermally and hydrologically active geothermal fields which are currently in production, for accelerated testing of CO2 utilisation, supercritical and dissolved CO2 injection, reactive transport and storage,
5.  Use a real field environment for the testing of supercritical and dissolved CO2 injection into a reservoir and provide the geothermal energy sector with the means to address the current climate change challenge through CO2 utilisation and storage.

## Aims

1.  Field test and implement of a new higher signal-to-noise ratio iDAS system and a new and novel vibratory-type electric seismic sources to provide layer-specific seismic monitoring capability for CCUS and geothermal applications.
2.  Accelerate testing and assessment of the effectiveness, and validation of a number of CO2 injection and plume monitoring techniques in carbonate reservoirs in the main.
3.  Gain further insights into the potential for injection induced seismicity in geothermal fields.
4.  Improve understanding of the fundamentals of field scale behaviour of injected supercritical and dissolved CO2 in geothermal reservoirs, and critical assessment of current theories.
5.  Develop strategies for pressure management in geothermal reservoirs through supercritical and dissolved CO2 injection and storage in order to extend the operational life of wells/fields with commercial benefits.
6.  Create a reliable techno-economic assessment method to assess the economic benefits of CCUS implementation in geothermal energy production.
7.  Develop a flexible and modular life cycle inventory model for geothermal CCUS implementation to enable the environmental assessment of the proposed technologies and support stakeholder communication.
8.  Develop and demonstrate an innovative CCUS technology to help accelerate CCS by opening it to an important CO2 emitting power sector.

## [Pilot sites](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/pilot-sites/)

Crucial to SUCCEED's work is the access to [two existing industrial scale geothermal production sites](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/pilot-sites/) and injection/monitoring wells. These will be used to pilot the technologies as they are developed, with the potential to upscaling to industrial size in an early commercial phase.

The project will inject CO2 into the reservoir either in supercritical state (at [Kizildere in Turkey](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/pilot-sites/kizildere/)), or as dissolved gas in the re-injected geothermal fluid (at [the Hellisheidi field in Iceland](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/pilot-sites/hellisheidi/)).

## [Rock-fluid interactions](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/rock-fluid-interactions/)

The SUCCEED team will undertake [research into the geochemical, geomechanical and geophysical response of reservoirs to CO2 injection](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/rock-fluid-interactions/).

The aim is to understand the response of carbonate rocks to the injection of supercritical CO2 at high-pressure/high-temperature reservoir conditions, seismic response, impact on flow properties, geochemistry and the integrity of the reservoir rock on change in strength.

The results will be used by the team when looking at [field performance](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/monitoring-of-co2-injection-operations/), as well as [long-term injection strategies planning](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/reservoir-modelling/).

## [Monitoring of CO2 injection operations](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/monitoring-of-co2-injection-operations/)

The team will be working on monitoring the CO2 injection operations, site performance and reservoir behaviour at Kizildere and Hellisheidi sites.

This will provide information on the changes in field parameters and in geochemistry and geomechanics of the geothermal field, as well as the fate of the CO2 plume. They will use different, site-adjusted surface and downhole monitoring activities.

Besides the application of standard monitoring technologies, the team will develop and use new and innovative seismic monitoring techniques and hardware (electric seismic-vibrator; iDAS system).

## [Reservoir modelling](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/reservoir-modelling/)

SUCCEED will be using computer models to investigate alternative injection and reservoir performance scenarios.

They will use pre- and post-CO2 injection simulations of the changes in reservoir pressure, associated geochemistry and geomechanical reservoir properties. The models will be calibrated using historical and project-obtained monitoring data. A key part of the workwill be the fault/fracture behaviour and potential for induced seismicity with different injection/production scenarios.

## [CO2 injection strategies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/co2-injection-strategies/)

The team will undertake a techno-economic assessment and optimisation of a field-wide/regional CO2 injection strategy.

They will identify strategies that optimise CO2 injection as well as potential CO2 storage performance and geothermal energy production in the field.

The studies will investigate different CO2 injection strategies, including injection-wells selection and injection rates, to evaluate their performance in terms of long-term pressure maintenance of the geothermal field while minimising production of injected CO2.

The work will also investigate the development and implementation of a regional-scale CO2 transport infrastructure for use in CO2 injection along the [Büyük Menderes Graben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCy%C3%BCk_Menderes_Graben "Büyük Menderes Graben link opens in a new window") and the regional CCUS potential in the area.

## [Life-cycle environmental impacts](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/life-cycle-environmental-impacts/)

SUCCEED will establish life-cycle assessment (LCA) models that reflect the engineering processes in order to assess the scalability of enhanced geothermal and CCUS systems considering environmental and resource constraints

## [Stakeholder Engagement](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/succeed/research/stakeholder-engagement/)

The team will investigate and develop stakeholder and public communication and education activities with regards to the CCUS technology blueprint developed and the validation of monitoring, modelling, and verification methodologies applicable to these systems.
