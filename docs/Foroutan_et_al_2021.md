# Evolution of fracture permeability and aperture during CO2 storage in varyingly cemented sedimentary rocks

## Abstract

- In this study, CO2-enriched brine was injected into two pure [[limestone]] and two calcite- and quartz-cemented [[sandstone]] specimens, artificially fractured by a circular saw.

- The CO2-enriched brine was injected under two flow rates differing by a factor of 2, to simulate the reservoir condition closer and farther from the injection well. 

- Also, the specimens were subjected to different stress levels under loading/unloading stages to simulate different reservoir conditions. 

- The ICP-OES (Inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry) analysis was performed at the end of each experiment to evaluate the extent of potential dissolution/precipitation. 

- Injecting CO2-enriched brine into the pure calcite specimen, under the higher injection rate, resulted in the creation of new flow channels, leading to a significant increase of hydraulic aperture and permeability (20.6 times). 

- However, under the lower injection rate, the fracture channelization was limited to the areas close to the inlet, which led to fracture permeability enhancement of 6 times. 

- On the other hand, in calcite- and quartz-cemented sandstone specimens, the increase of hydraulic aperture and fracture permeability was more pronounced under the lower injection rates, which was attributed to the increased kinetic rate of geochemical reactions. 

- In this regard, the chemical analysis revealed that increasing the effluent concentration of Ca2ï¼‹ and K was higher under the lower injection rates.

- The results of ultrasonic velocity measurements revealed a velocity slow-down upon injecting CO2-enriched brine, however, the velocity increased upon increasing the Confining pressure level. 

- The results of this study shed light on the importance of different mineralogical features of reservoir rocks under various reservoir conditions. 

- Due to the complexity of fracture response during CO2 storage, the results of this study can serve as a benchmark for numerical simulations. 

- Also, the chemical analysis and fracture permeability evolution results can be used as inputs in reservoir scale modeling.
